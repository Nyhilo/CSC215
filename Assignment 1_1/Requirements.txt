Body Mass Index Calculator
The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE),
and to introduce some basic C++ fundamentals like console I/O, comments, variables, data types, and math operations.

You must create a simple body mass index (BMI) calculator. BMI is a measurement of the relative percentages of fat and muscle mass in the human body.
The BMI is equal to the weight in kilograms, divided by the square of the height in meters:

BMI = kg / (m*m)

For this project you must:

Create a C++ Project that will prompt the user for two values (a height in inches, and a weight in pounds)
Use cout to display prompts and results to the user.
Prompt for user to enter height in inches
Prompt for user to enter weight in pounds
Use cin to store these inputs appropriately.
Calculate the BMI from the user inputs
Use cout to display results to the user.
Display BMI to user.
Thank them for using your program.
Program should then pause and wait for the user to press a key before closing.
